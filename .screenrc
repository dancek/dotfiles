# 
# Anything I don't describe is treated literally.
# 
# %?          - Start of a conditional statement.
#  %F         - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus (i.e. it
#               is the only window or the currently active one).
#  %{-b bc}   - Turn off bold, blue foreground, cyan background.
# %:          - else
#  %{-b bb}   - Turn off bold, blue foreground, blue background (this obscures
#               the text on non-focused windows and just gives a blue line).
# %?          - End conditional statement.
#  %C         - time (hh:mm, leading space) in 12 hour format
#  %D         - Three-letter day-of-week appreviation
#  %M         - Three-letter month appreviation
#  %d         - Day of the month
#  %H         - hostname
#  %?         - Start of conditional statement.
#   %F        - Use this part of the statement if the window has focus.
#   %{+u wb}  - underlined, white foreground, blue background
#  %?         - End conditional (if not focused, text remaind blue on blue).
#    %L=      - truncation/padding point.  With the 'L' qualifier, basically
#               just acts as a reference point.  Further truncation/padding is
#               done relative to here, not the beginning of the string
#    %-Lw     - window list up to but not including the current window (-),
#               show window flags (L)
#    %45>     - truncation/padding marker; place this point about 45% of the
#               way into the display area (45)
#    %{+b by} - add bold (still underlined from before), blue foreground,
#               yellow background
#      %n     - number of the current window
#      %f     - flags for current window
#      %t     - title of current window
#    %{-}     - undo last color change (so now we're back to underlined white
#               on blue)  (technically, this is a pop; a second invocation
#               would drop things back to unadorned blue on cyan)
#    %+Lw     - window list from the next window on (-), show window flags (L)
#    %-0<     - truncation/padding point.  Place this point zero spaces (0)
#               from the right margin (-).
