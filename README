These are some of my dotfiles. Nothing fancy.

This is a very simple setup, I just created a git repo in my home dir and
excluded "*". I only need the following features at the time:
 * version control
 * backups
 * a way to update my dotfiles on different machines

I used to have a script for syncing my dotfiles but it wasn't very fun to
maintain... I guess this might be a better option.


Note to self: cloning to a new place works like this:
cd
git init
git remote add origin git://github.com/dancek/dotfiles.git
git fetch
git branch master origin/master
git checkout master
